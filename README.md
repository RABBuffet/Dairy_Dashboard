# Farm Data Management Project

## About this Project and Data

This project aims to address challenges of farm data management through organizing data and improving data awareness and accessibility. The goal is to improve accessibility, usability, compatibility, and convenience for end users or other stakeholders.

The data used in this dashboard is from the Harper Adams Future Farm Dairy Unit. The data contains dairy production and milk quality variables recorded on a daily basis from 2018 to 2023.

## Repository Contents

- `dairy.xlsx`: This is the raw data file as received from the source.
- `baseline.qmd`: A Quarto Markdown file for creating a dashboard. 

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `dairy.xlsx`  to understand the raw data structure and format.
3. Review the `Tyding.R` code to see the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data.
4. Analyze the `tidy_data/` directory to understand the cleaned and processed data files.
5. Open the `InteractiveDashboard.qmd` and `StaticDashboard.qmd` files in a Quarto-compatible editor (e.g., RStudio, Visual Studio Code) to view and modify the dashboard code.
6. Render the dashboards to generate the `InteractiveDashboard.html` and `StaticDashboard.html` files for viewing in a web browser.
